NR Log

NR Log, is a fictional website. It's objective, is to simulate a well managed logistics business, with a well designed and modern website. It's storyline inspiration was to fix a real world problem related to logistics in Brazil, mainly in the North region, where the logistics systems are not good.

The website has well designed responsive design techniques, built with Tailwind CSS and ASP.NET Core partial views. It also has register and login features (with session)
alongside an Azure Websites deploy, with a MySQL database, built with ORM using Entity Framework Core. Hope you enjoy!
